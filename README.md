# Text-to-Story Generator

This is a Streamlit-based web app that generates creative stories using Cohere's powerful language models. You can provide a story prompt, and the app will generate a creative continuation or full story based on the prompt. Adjust the creativity level and length of the story as per your preference.

You can access the deployed version of the app here:  
[**Text-to-Story Generator**](https://text-to-story.streamlit.app/)

## Features

- **Generate Stories**: Provide a prompt, and the app will generate a continuation or a full story.
- **Adjustable Story Length**: Control the length of the story using a slider that determines the maximum number of tokens (words/characters).
- **Creativity Control**: Use a slider to adjust the "creativity" level (temperature). Higher values lead to more creative outputs.
- **Cohere API Integration**: The app uses Cohere's API to generate text, ensuring high-quality, natural language generation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Cohere Python Client

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-to-story-generator.git
   cd text-to-story-generator
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **requirements.txt**
   ```
   streamlit
   cohere
   ```

4. Get your **Cohere API key** by signing up at [Cohere](https://cohere.ai/). Once you have the key, replace the placeholder `API_KEY` in your code with your actual API key.

## Running the App Locally

1. Start the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## How to Use

- **Enter a prompt**: Provide a starting point for the story in the text input area (e.g., "A lone traveler ventures into a mysterious forest...").
- **Adjust Story Length**: Use the "Story Length" slider to set the maximum number of tokens (words/characters) in the generated story.
- **Set Creativity Level**: Use the "Creativity Level" slider to control how creative or random the generated text is.
- **Generate**: Click the "Generate Story" button to get a creative continuation of your story idea.

## Example

**Prompt**: `A lone traveler ventures into a mysterious forest where strange things begin to happen.`

**Generated Story**:
```
As the sun began to set over the dense woodland, casting an eerie glow across the landscape, the traveler could not help but feel a sense of trepidation as they ventured deeper into the mysterious forest...
```

## API Reference

The app integrates with Cohere's text generation API using the `command-xlarge` model. You can adjust parameters like:
- `max_tokens`: Controls the maximum length of the generated story.
- `temperature`: Controls randomness; higher values result in more creativity and diversity in the generated text.
